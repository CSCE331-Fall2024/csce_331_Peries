                During my time in college, Iâ€™ve had the chance to explore different areas of computer
                engineering, from hardware to software. I delved deep into the intricacies of machine
                learning and examined the delicate interplay between hardware performance and algorithmic
                efficiency, constantly finding new avenues to explore. Through multiple projects and research,
                my interest has firmly centered on the intersection of scientific and high-performance 
                computing, specifically in utilizing advanced hardware to further boost and parallelize 
                complex algorithms. This includes optimizing algorithms such as k-means clustering, the 
                Push-Relabel Maximum Flow algorithm, and many others. In addition to my personal projects, 
                I have completed internships at HPE and ANSYS (now part of Synopsys as of 2025). During my 
                time at HPE, I spearheaded the creation of a prototype microservice using the Java Spring 
                Boot web server framework and the React JavaScript library. I also developed a frontend web 
                UI using the Angular web framework, which required me to learn the TypeScript language. Apart 
                from HPE, I undertook two internships at ANSYS, working with the semiconductor simulation team.
                At ANSYS, I helped develop a computer vision algorithm to identify new wire etchings and 
                created a multi-layer perceptron to enhance the speed of a parasitic extraction solver. 
                Additionally, I contributed to the creation of a visualization tool that aids users in 
                analyzing the different layers of metal and dielectric materials in their chips. Currently, 
                I am working on my Senior thesis and plan to apply to graduate school to further pursue my passion for 
                advanced computing and innovative technology solutions.
