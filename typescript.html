    <h1>What is Typescript</h1>
    <p> 
        TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that 
        adds optional type annotations, allowing for better code 
        reliability and maintainability. Developed by Microsoft, it 
        compiles to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with 
        existing frameworks and browsers. The key benefit of 
        TypeScript is its ability to catch errors at compile-time 
        rather than runtime, leading to fewer bugs. It enhances 
        developer productivity by offering features like autocompletion,
        code navigation, and refactoring tools. TypeScript also 
        supports modern JavaScript features, ensuring future-proof code
        while improving collaboration in large-scale projects through 
        consistent and self-documented code.
