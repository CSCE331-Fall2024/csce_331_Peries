                        The houston marathon is a race sponsored by the Chevron Oil company. I've worked here as a 
                        volunteer where I was in charge of keeping track of people's belongings.

                        Build is an organization that helps create portable medical clinics. Students at
                        Texas A&M have the opportunity to volunteer and help with the creation of these clinics.
                        I have volunteered here multiple times and encourage others to do the same as well.
